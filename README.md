There's a Job for That
======================

A tool to guide job seekers, in plain language, to the jobs or careers that match their skills, goals, and needs.

Ideated at the White House Data Jam on 21st Century Jobs.

Synopsis (DRAFT):

    We're trying to improve the user experience from the job seekers perspective when searching / using job boards, especially those that are unemployed and going through the process of applying with little to no professional experience to speak of. Examples might include: returning veterans / military; people with skills in crafts / tradesmen that do not know how to explain their abilities in a manner that is transferrable (in a situation where the trade / skill is no longer marketable); people that possess strong soft skills (personable, customer service oriented, etc.); etc.

    We identified this type of 'naive resume jargon' persona as a key to helping match appropriate skills with appropriate jobs. People who don't know how to explain their skills / abilities. We also discussed how we might cater to this persona through a better / more guided user experience when filling out a job / unemployment application. We are considering developing a schema / metadata model (or algorithm) that makes such matches easier / more accurate than what's currently out there (lots of erroneous matches).
