2. Question view: Presents text for a single question (swipe left for no, right for yes - same layout for each of the three question categories)

3. Keep/reject jobs view (text list from which to reject/keep before moving on to explore jobs)

4. Explore your list view: Lets use view a list of matched jobs and click each one to Job view

5. Job view: Lets the user explore one job (swipe left to find training near you, right to find an open position, down for "what's this")
