As someone who is unemployed I want to find a job in a different industry so that I can pay my bills.


As a college graduate I want to learn about my job options according to my interest. 


As someone without a college degree I want to figure out what skills do I have that are compatible with current jobs that are open. 


As a mother that has been recently laid off being out of work is something I can't afford, I want to find a job in a way that is quick and easy so that I can get back to work quicker.


As someone that has been working in retail for 5 years I am looking to make a transition. I want to be able to highlight my skills based on my experiences and see if there are any industries that my skills can be applied to so that I can make steps towards a sustainable career. 


As someone who is over 50 years old I am scared that I won't find work or that no one will hire me. Since the internet is the main way to find jobs I want to look for work in a way that is easy for me to use so that I won't feel so nervous.
